Dockerfile

a text file without any extension that contains all the commands to be executed to generate an image.
FROM

a Dockerfile must begin with a FROM instruction . initializes a new build stage
sets the base image for subsequent instructions
RUN

command to create and start containers using the current image
commits the results so that the resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the Dockerfile.
WORKDIR

creates (if not exists) and set the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.
COPY

copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path <dest>
EXPOSE

specify the network ports of the container at runtime
specify the network protocol that the port listens (TCP is the default)
NOTE: EXPOSE does not actually publish the port -- it functions more as a documentation tool
CMD

provide defaults for an executing container
if the defaults do not include an executable, you must specify an ENTRYPOINT
NOTE: there can be only one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile
